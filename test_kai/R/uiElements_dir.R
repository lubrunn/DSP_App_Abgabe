                            made sure to have a roughly equivalent number of tweets per day. Our app focuses on the main stock indices in DAX

                            tweets using no search term as well as using company specific search terms. For most companies, the search terms
                            included their name as well as various twitter handles. For companies such as Apple or Caterpillar only twitter
                            handles were used in order to avoid scraping wrong tweets. For the company tweets we set the upper limit of tweets
                            to receive to 5000 and for the unfiltered searches to roughly 100,000 per day. All searches were performed for English
